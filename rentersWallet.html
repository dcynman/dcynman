      <h2>Summary</h2>

    <!--Project Summary Information-->
    <section class="summaryInfo">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Renters are losing key documents in a paper-dominated field, and it is costing them. Move-in damage forms, contractor reimbursement slips, security deposit records, utility account information: the list continues. Renter’s need organization. Furthermore, they are subjected to property management software that is heavily landlord centered with no renter autonomy.</p>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Clean it up and keep it clean. Renter’s Wallet is a space tailored exclusively for rental-related documents. By virtue of the narrow scope and organization specificity, users are intrinsically encouraged to keep a clean cloud. Renter’s Wallet offers a streamlined organizational system that makes digitizing, sorting, and retrieving files seamless.</p>

    <!--Discovery and Research-->
    <section class="discoveryAndResearch">
      <h1>Discovery & Research</h1>
      <h2>User Surveys</h2>
      <p>To better understand users’ behaviors and values, my process began with a survey. I’ve surfaced the highlights below. All statistics are based on a sample size of 15.</p>

      <h3>BEHAVIORS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>86.7% of respondents use some form of cloud storage, 92% of which use Google Drive. </li>
          <p>Drive is a key competitor--a solution will have to provide value where Drive falls short</p>
        <li>38.5% of renters (largest segment) are keeping their rental agreement in their email inbox.</li>
          <p>Users are finding a storage solution but perhaps not the most elegant. There is potential for adoption with a better solution.</p>
        <li>61.5% of cloud storage users store work and personal files on the same platform.</li>
          <p>The combination is driving cloud clutter.<br>Separating work and personal could provide value.</p>
      </ul>

      <h3>VALUE (0-10)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>92.3% of renters rated accessibility from any device or browser as most important (8-10) </li>
        <li>77% of renters rated the ability to share files with collaborators as most important (8-10)</li>
        <li>53.9% of renters indicated having one place to house all rental related items as very important (7-10)</li>
          <p>The moderate value indication shows that secondary features such as accessibility and shareability will add value to primary functionality.</p>
      </ul>

      <aside class="blockQuote">
        <p>I knew I had my lease, but I just don’t want to go through 20 weeks of emails. The search feature works, but I always have to click  a number of tangential correspondences</p>

    <!--Competitive Analysis-->
    <section class="competitiveAnalysis">
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>To assess market viability, I conducted a SWOT analysis spanning cloud storage and property management software. My representatives were: Google Drive, Tenant Cloud, and Buildium. In sum: Google Drive falls short on organizational motivation, while management software is landlord centered, neglecting key renter needs. Ultimately, this yields an entrance for a cloud storage system designed specifically for renters and rental document organization without the bloat of deep landlord connection. Read the full analysis here.</p>

    <!--Personas-->
    <section class='personas'>
      <h2>User Personas</h2>
      <p>I’m pleased to introduce Harper and Alicia. Collectively, they represent Renter Wallet’s target audience: young (~23-35), tech savvy renters in metropolitan areas. Organizer Harper loves nothing more than a clean dashboard, while On-the-go Alicaia is deeply in need of an organization solution. Harper and Alicia are the synthesis of the qualitative and quantitative research proceeding them and are the drivers behind the UX/UI decisions that follow.</p>

      <div class='persona'>
        <img src="" alt="Harper">
        <h6>ORGANIZER</h6>
        <p>Age: 32  | Location: Pittsburgh, PA | Gender: Neutral</p>
        <p>Harper is a self-appointed “tech nerd.” They read Product Hunt daily, partly because it helps them stay current on new technologies that might influence their work, but they also just really enjoy it. They are a chronic organizer: Creative Cloud for design work, Drive for work documents, Dropbox for personal storage, and Box for misc. files. They are always looking for a way to streamline organization and are always ready to try a new technology if it has been vetted by the community. </p>
        <h6>GOALS</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Bolster organization with new technology</li>
          <li>Stay relevant in tech.</li>
          <li>Integrate landlord communication</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>FRUSTRATIONS</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Strained relationship with landlord</li>
          <li>Moves every year and accumulates many documents</li>
          <li>Applications that try to do to much, and in turn do little well.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“I’m over the Bay, but not tech. I still wake up each morning and scroll through my feeds, hungry for the next thing that makes my life just a little bit better.”</p>
      </div>

      <div class='persona'>
        <img src="" alt="Alicia">
        <h6>ON-THE-GO</h6>
        <p>Age: 27 | Location: Asheville, NC | Gender: Female</p>
        <p>Alicia is proud to call herself technologically savvy. She loves adopting new technology but leaves them before finishing onboarding. She does use Google Drive and Dropbox for work and her personal files. Her work drives are meticulously organized, but her personal ones are a pigsty. She is overwhelmed by the notion of organizing them. Files have accumulated since her early college years. She relies solely on the search bar to find files, which works 70% of the time. She has no idea where her rental documents are but could probably find them if she had to.</p>
        <h6>GOALS</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Commit to and maintain organization</li>
          <li>Feel secure knowing where important documents are</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>FRUSTRATIONS</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Restarting is easier than organizing</li>
          <li>Running out of free space on Google Drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“I would definitely feel a little more adult if I could point to where my rental documents were. I don’t even know if I have renter’s insurance--and I live in a flood plain.”</p>

      <h1>Branding & Identity</h1>
      <h2>Ideating</h2>
      <p>Creating brand began with word association and mindmapping. The emergent characteristics were: Clean, Straight Forward, Trustworthy Contemporary and Financial. </p>

    <!--Logo Work-->
    <section class='logo'>
      <h2>Logo</h2>
      <p>Wallet’s were fun to play with--folded, unfolded, sideways, upside down, empty, and stuffed to the brim. The geometric folded form lent itself nicely to the base of a home or a file. I experimented with the home idea, adding monograms, chimneys, doors, the works. Ultimately I abandoned this direction since it would not scale down legibly.<br><br>
        Experimenting further, the single pocket wallet ambiguously resembled a file icon. To further the file notion, I colored it a more exciting version of the classic and trusted manilla envelope. The cloud emerges from the wallet to clearly communicate the applications function: cloud storage. Lastly, the logo was designed to convey jovial familiarity. The blocky “W” representing “wallet” plays on 90’s word art: catering directly to the 20-30 year old target demographic that grew up on MS Office and Paint.<br><br>All in all, the design choices were predicated on communicating a sense of contemporary design on a strong foundation of trust.</p>

    <!--Type and Color-->
    <section class='typeAndColor'>
      <h2>Type & Color</h2>
      <p>Oswald and Quattrocento, are tag-teamed to continue the contemporary yet trustworthy tone. Oswald’s tall and condensed glyphs graft feelings of emboldened seriousness. Quattrocento, our serifed representative, complements Oswald with it’s no frills legibility. All in all, the combination delivers a contemporary sense of trust. </p>
      <p>For energy and attention I used a brightened mustard. In order to balance the excitement, I introduce a tinted forest green. This also served the dual purpose of providing a AAA contrast ratio with white text in the foreground. The deep navy brings trust while the powder blue brightens the palette with a modern feel.</p>
