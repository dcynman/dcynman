      <p>Hi there! I’m David, a UX/UI designer with a penchant for bread making.</p>

    <!--Biography-->
    <section>
      <p>I’ll go out on a limb here and say that the two aren’t as dissimilar as face value suggests. Both demand a delicate balance of scientific attention and artistic intuition. It’s this inter-reliance, a tension of sorts, that keeps me designing.<br><br>
        My introduction to design was at Joyable, a mental health tech company in San Francisco. I supported clients through our 3-month Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program for Social Anxiety and Depression. Representing the voice of the user, I was often brought into design meetings to guide client-centered decision making. This exposure to design thinking set my course.<br><br>
        I took every opportunity I had to work with the design team. I lead a brainstorming session on client engagement. I wire-framed part of our app in preparation for our first mobile engineer hire. I volunteered for lunchtime user testing. I was hungry.<br><br>
        A limiting belief stifled by appetite:<br><br>
        <strong>I am not a designer</strong><br><br>
        I had no formal, even informal, training. In the San Francisco sea of stunning visual designs, a transition felt insurmountable.<br><br>
        I pursued a parallel dream: bread. After a year of sourdough baking at Wildflour Bread, I knew I had to return to design. Bread will forever be a passion of mine, but I learned that it lives best in my life as a hobby, not profession.<br><br>
        So I accepted a post-baccalaureate research fellowship at UC Santa Barbara. Simultaneously, I began Bloc, an 8-month mentorship-based UX/UI design program. This was my “full send”. I wanted to grow my research background and test my visual design aptitude.<br><br>
        Looking back at my diversity of experience, I see how each informs my design approach. Peer listening skills mark my user interviews. Empathy frames my problem-solving approach. Attention to detail drives my research.<br><br>
        I design because it calls upon emotional intelligence, empiricism, empathy, and art; that’s my cocktail of choice... and Manhattans.
